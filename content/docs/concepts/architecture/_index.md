## Introduction

This document provides an overview of Kubirds's components and dependencies
and how they interact with each other.

Because **Kubirds** relies on [TektonCD](https://tekton.dev) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io),
it is recommended to also read their documentation, but not mandatory.

## How to read?

This document is splitted in 3 parts:

 - **System:** describes the high level architecture
 - **Container:** describes the infrastructure and deployments
 - **Component:** describes the application architecture
