# Introduction

> It is recommended to first read the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide before continuing this article.

In this tutorial, you will learn to setup the monitoring of your web service using Kubevisor's declarative configuration.

In most cases, all you need is to:

 - ensure your web service availability via periodic HTTP requests
 - notify your team when the service is unavailable (ie: via Slack)
 - plan time windows where monitoring is unneeded (ie: during an upgrade)
