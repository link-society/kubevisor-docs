## Who are we ?

[Link Society](https://link-society.com) is a french company built by two
passionate engineers: **David Delassus** and **Jonathan LabÃ©jof**.

We first met in 2013 as we joined the same developper team. After 3 years, we
quit our jobs and started our own business as a software editor.

Our goal is simple:

> Providing the user the tools he needs

And to accomplish that goal, we include the end-user in the design phase of our
projects.

After studying how supervision was implemented by our clients, **Kubirds** was
born.

## Simplicity first

*Ease of use* is our top one priority. Complex tools costs more in development,
in training, and often gets in the way. We design our products so that the user
spend the least possible amount of time using them.

Therefore, the *efficiency* of the tools we provide is a direct consequence.
